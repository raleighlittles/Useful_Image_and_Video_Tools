# About

This repository contains my collection of helpful image and video scripts. Each directory has its own README.

* [Auto Vox Dashcam video parser](./autovox_dashcam_video_parser/README.md) ~ A script that extracts GPS data from your dashcam videos

* [Simple image combiner](./simple_image_combiner/README.md) ~ A script that uses [imagemagick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick) to easily combine a directory of images into a single one

* [Simple video combiner](./video_combiner/README.md) ~ A script that uses [FFMPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) to combine a directory of videos into one
